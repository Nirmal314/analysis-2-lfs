The story revolves around the key characters- Disha, Tahir, Chandu, Zoya and Salim, etc. Disha is a small town, next-door girl. She is an orphan raised by her grandfather. Her grandfather wants to see her happily married to a good guy before he retires but Disha has plans of her own. She is in love with Tahir and is ready to take any measure for getting married to him. She is convinced that Tahir is the key to her happiness and her dreams. Tahir is an auto driver and a small-time criminal which Disha is unaware of. He along with his friend Chandu commits petty crimes to make some quick bucks on the side. During her quest of getting married to Tahir against the wishes of her grandfather, Disha along with Tahir and Chandu crosses paths with a local strongman Salim. Disha, an innocent girl whose dreams get shattered gets entangled in the mess because of her blind faith. She is caught up in a dangerous situation for no wrongdoing of her own.

tt21276180,"We were already familiar with Gaël Lépingle's taste for provincial small towns, and with his precise, insistent, and often generous interest in their inhabitants and their lust for adventures, as shown in his work, from Julien (FID 2010) to Seuls les pirates (FID 2018). Provincial towns are shown here through the prism of the journey of boys who like boys, narrated by Gaël Lépingle like three tales set in three different places, three slices of life involving choices. In each of these tales, the director portrays in delicate touches various ways of living as a homosexual, in places where it is possible, or sometimes unthinkable, but always steering clear of the usual drama and clichés of the genre. In the opening scene, a young man seems to be dreaming of a reality different from the business he is about to take over and the married life that goes with it; he is drawn to the spicy life of a queer vaudeville troupe performing in his village. Then we follow the wanders of a teenager, the unlikely experience of his slender figure walking the streets of his village. Finally, we catch a glimpse of the fetishist passion of a respectable teacher, before he is sent back to his path of renunciation. These three portraits end up composing a fresco. Gaël Lépingle becomes the cartographer of uncharted areas of desire, in landscapes that are devoid of qualities and sharpness, but filled with the dreadful banality of preordained destinies. So many paths to take and decisions to make for these provincial boys. Lépingle subtly delineates dead ends and openings, and lingers on the in-between: in between words and bodies, in between desire and bleak life, in between bodies and landscapes, searching for the right distance between beings. With dressing-up and its possibilities as a secret formula that connects them all. (Nicolas Feodoroff)",movie,Smalltown Boys,Des garçons de province,0,2022.0,,82.0,Drama,6.3,84.0,0

Yes, it's a silent movie in this world full of talking cinema and complicated story line that follows an easy, breezy story path with a tint of comedy and satire.

The whole set of actors is new and thus adds a freshness to the cast. From obsession to love, frustration to hope, the film takes you to a roller-coaster ride of emotions in a short span of time. The background score by Foley artist Gayadhar Nayak indeed becomes the sound of silence that holds the story perfectly in place.

Gentle and reflective, yet unshakable in her determination, Logan is a champion in the making. Besides her skill and sheer grit, she has a loving family, an elite group of horses, and a home on her ancestral lands. Those are invaluable, but this rider will need more for victory. As Hanuse follows her through one competition after another, we see courage put to the test, and also get a picture of the other factors involved in the sport-including blind circumstance.

Logan's bond with her horses is palpable, and Hanuse shows us her tender interactions with them contrasted with gripping races. The animals are beautiful in their mute strength, and the director honours them with loving, graceful images. The connections explored here are profound and lasting: those between Father and Daughter, animal and human, family and community, ancestral tradition and contemporary life.

This narrative is set in remote villages of Maharashtra where girls, from an extremely young age, have to bear the laborious task of fetching water for their households. The ordeal involves traveling long distances, often under scorching heat and sometimes barefoot, balancing heavy pots of water on their heads. This day-to-day hardship deprives the girls of their innocent childhood and obstructs their educational pursuits. Jyoti and Rani, who aspire to become a policewoman and a nurse respectively, find their dreams fading away amidst the toil of water collection. The documentary is produced by Shaz Memon, the founder of Wells on Wheels, a water charity aimed at improving the lives and education of young girls in Maharashtra. The film is directed by award-winning Saumitra Singh, who was deeply moved by the heart-rending stories of these young girls and decided to spotlight their predicament to the world. Sanjay Kapoor, a prominent Indian film actor, and an ambassador for Wells on Wheels, lends his voice and support to the cause, hoping to illuminate a path to a promising future for these girls.",movie,No Water Land,No Water Land,0,2022.0,,,Documentary,8.9,12.0,0

There are 60 species of mangrove and mangrove associates in Sundarbans with each species flowering at a different time of the year. To make people experience this primordial landscape, we have created the one hour film ""Drifting in the Waters of Sundarbans"". Through this film, we take you on a one hour relaxing virtual boat ride through the mangroves of Sundarbans. You listen to the sounds of birds, soft sound of flowing water, wild blowing on the leaves of mangroves, crocodiles basking in the mud flats and then sliding into water, deer grazing peacefully and many more to relax. This film is aimed to give you a raw feel of being there in the heart of nature as we experience during our explorations. So there is no human voice to disturb you nor is there any composed music. All you hear are the natural sounds. You can even close your eyes and listen with headphones the soft sounds to relax your soul. Research studies have shown that Natural sounds improve health, increase positive affect, and lower stress and annoyance. Simply listening to natural sounds results in decrease in mortality rates and stress and improves mental health, cognitive performance and even birth outcomes. So listen as well as play it for your loved ones. Sundarbans is not only a place worthy of visit for clicking selfies. Sundarbans changes you without you knowing.—Sabyasachi Patra",movie,Drifting in the Waters of Sundarbans,Drifting in the Waters of Sundarbans,0,2023.0,,60.0,Adventure,9.4,40.0,0

It is the journey of Archi, in early forties, a highly successful professional working in MNC and his wife Ishaani, a lady of mid-thirties, spanning across ten years from their marriage to present day, shown in flashback mode. The story starts on the morning of Mahalaya (first day of celebration of Goddess Durga Festival) with 'Mahishashurmardini' being played on the radio and ends with the Dhaak (drums) during Bodhon of Goddess Durga on Sashthi (sixth day). A crisis comes unexpectedly to the family when their son Ujaan has a sudden heart attack and the family fights it with all their might during these six days. But there is a deeper crisis in Ishaani's life -where she has to face an unexpected problem. So parallely we see two stories - real time six days with imminent crisis - a flashback of ten years, which starts expectedly but gets into a different unchartered territory for her when she embarks on a personal journey to realize a joint dream and has to fight with external world and internal dilemmas on the way. She gets positive helping hands, negative vibes, strong support as well as unwelcoming comments. The story shows different faces, relationships, incidents during her journey. Archi with his exposure to Western world as well as from his inherent idealism has somehow accepted the facts and shoulders the responsibilities with aplomb. But it is a different battle for Ishani - a crisis of a woman - a mother. Can she win it?

With compassion in his heart he found energy that can move mountains and create miracles. The film is an important chapter in the history of post - partition Punjab. A varied approach to meaningful events would carry great appeal and emotionally connect with the audience. The rich music score soaked in traditional punjabi sounds, Shabads, songs and the culturally rich rhythms emanate fresh waves of sound that the listeners will savour with delight. The tireless research done for the film makes it a very authentic and genuine attempt to recreate the life and the times of a penniless man who calls himself "" a humble sweeper at the footsteps of Gods abode"". He ferried an invalid for many years on his shoulders and over a span of time the burden of every helpless human became a garland around his neck. In his arduous journey he was joined by millions of altruistic human beings who supported his noble cause without knowing the sheer magnitude of the herculean task of the man who undertook it.

When Kim, a young Vietnamese Australian woman, hears about her estranged father's death, she returns to Vietnam for the first time in 10 years to begin the process of reconciliation and healing. Caught between two worlds, Kim must decide what she wants to learn and take from her homeland.

Side A Side B, a real world musical structured like a music album, features eight songs, performed and recorded live on the train. The film, hence, plays out in eight scenes (apart from the Intro and the Bonus Track in the opening and closing credits) shot with two phone cameras in eight long takes. The musical juxtaposes two contrasting worlds and perspectives employing two contrasting narratives from the 90s. The sacred realism of the Dogme narrative (preserved by long takes and live music on location) is intercut with the time and space jumping aesthetic of the music video narrative. The young musician-actors have sung and performed all songs themselves and the music director plays the musical narrator of the film.

tt7071122,"The most dangerous madmen are those created by religion, and people whose aim is to disrupt the society always know how to make good use of them on occasion. With various outfits of terrorism spreading its tentacles across the world this three centuries old quote of Denis Diderot seems to be apt and as contemporary as it can be. With vulnerable youths falling for the stories of getting an opportunity to work for Allah and empowered with thoughts that your hands will kill the innocent but Allah will forgive all has given these youths the notion that all is fair on the course of Jihad. In the history of mankind, fanaticism has caused more harm than any vice. Despite a space of several years the wounds inflicted by the Indian army in Kashmir were still fresh in Altaaf's mind when he joined the terrorist outfit with the pious thoughts of wiping away the enemies of Islam. Little did he know that he had in turn, gullibly fallen into the trap of people with vested interest and crooked ideas. During one of his assignments Altaaf meets Bhavna, widow of a doctor they had once killed on the suspicion of being an informer of the army. Holed out at Bhavna's house, Altaaf undergoes a metamorphosis as he witnesses Bhavna's plight and helplessness. History however, is replete with the stories of Jihadis or the soldiers of the Holy War, who at some point during their fight for religion realize that they have taken an erroneous decision. Realize that bullets can win wars but not hearts and in the bargain comprehend that they are treading on a path of no return. Jihad is the journey of the militant Altaaf and his realization of the futility of his holy war as he stumbles upon a few truths. That unfortunately Jihad is generally misunderstood to be true Islam. Whereas Islam stands for humanity. Islam prevails amidst brotherhood of people. And Altaaf also learns the supreme truth. That the true meaning of Jihad is not the holy war outside but the war within. Jihad is nothing but overpowering your inner devil. Firearms can give death, not life. Impart life if you can..!!.

New York Times rated him among top 10 sound mixing engineers of the world. Producers queued up at his door waiting for his mixing dates. Vidhu Vinod Chopra tells how Mangeshji mixed his first two films free of cost and helped him stand on his feet as a director and producer. Gulshan Rai, the producer of Director Yash Chopra's Deewar and Kabhi Kabhi lost faith in the films but Mangeshji's tips on reshooting & re-edit made those cult classics a commercial success. His dynamic range of work goes from the artistic extremes of Satyajit Ray and Shyam Benegal's art films to Manmohan Desai's commercial films. He could blend himself according to the needs of the subject, the film and the director. Before being a gifted technician Mangesh Desai was a freedom fighter, a nationalist and a patriot. As a freedom fighter he fought the British with smuggled revolvers and self-made bombs.

However, Gadhvi is no ordinary Gandhian, he believes he is the reincarnation of Mahatma Gandhi himself! And only by shattering this apparent delusion can Omkar succeed in his mission of suppressing the swelling anger against his masters, the establishment. What sets off as a motley cast of characters, takes a serious turn when Gadhvi becomes a social media hero- and the only way to bring him down seems to be to bring down Gadhvi's core beliefs.

tt9324614,"2 Nations 1 Obsession - Synopsis In terms of rivalries in world sport, there is arguably none as fierce as that between the Australia and Indian cricket. The team at Dickson Films have travelled far and wide on both continents to explore this fascinating sporting rivalry - from its inception until the present day. We explore the stories behind the remarkable 1986 Tied Test in Madras, the gripping final over bowled by Greg Matthews plus the remarkable nature behind Dean Jones' double hundred. Fast-forward 15 years and the 2001 series between the nations is widely regarded as one of the best series ever played by Cricket purists. In particular, the dramatic Third Test where a plucky young off spinner named Harbhajan Singh ripped through Australia to take 15 wickets for the match, and lead India to victory. But it was the infamous 'Monkey Gate' scandal in the 2007/08 series where relations between India and Australia reached its lowest ebb. This feature length Documentary goes behind the scenes to hear the real stories from the stars themselves - how and why the incident was so highly publicised at the time. India was bullied by the likes of England and Australia for many decades, but in this documentary, the rise of India into a genuine powerhouse - is chronicled in fascinating detail. No longer is the BCCI seen as the poorer cousin to the cricketing giants - it now rules the game. Border, Gavaskar, Matthews, Gilchrist, Shastri, Clark are just a few of the names who feature prominently during this film. 2 Nations 1 Obsession isn't just an epic Cricket story - it's a tale of how two countries with such different DNA - can be brought together for the love of a game.",movie,"2 Nations, 1 Obsession","2 Nations, 1 Obsession",0,2018.0,,100.0,"Documentary,Sport",8.6,48.0,0

Employed in an apparel shop at the heart of a busy city, the middle aged Nasir is a hard worker. He speaks humorously and makes others laugh. He is also endowed with a half-baked philosophical attitude, so he likes poetry. On Sundays he composes poems along the lines of Hindi film songs of the sixties and launches them in front of his co-workers. When he recites his poems, he starts with his right hand placed over his chest and with wave-like motions nearly brushing the noses of the listeners. He smokes ten Beedis a day and drinks four cups of tea. He goes for his midday prayers occasionally. Nasir's chronicle emerges through the detailed observation of his vicinity over the span of one particular day. As his day unfolds we find him to be a nimble romantic, marshaling a love of love, song, children, friendship, and even God to rise into something resembling a life well lived. But the increasing communal bigotry has other plans.",movie,Nasir,Nasir,0,2020.0,,85.0,Drama,7.1,338.0,0
